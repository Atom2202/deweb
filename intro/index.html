									<p>Datearth is a geopolitical Minecraft server with a real world map. Towns and nations strive for power and glory with diplomacy, military, and war. Start a town and recruit residents. Form a nation and make alliances. Gather resources and build your military to conquer the earth!</p>
									<h2>The World Map</h2>
									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/worldmap.png" alt=""/></span></div>
											<div class="col-8">
												<p>The map is a replica of the real world earth generated from real world data. The cobblestone walls represent the country borders. The cobblestone on the ground represents population density, like a city. Deposits of minerals in the map are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/major-deposits/map-us.html">real data</a>.<br><br>You can view a live map of the world where the currently online players and town regions around the world are shown at <a target="_blank" href="https://datearth.com/map"><b>datearth.com/map</b></a>.</p>

									<h2>Towns</h2>
									<p>You can form a town with $2000. Invite residents to expand and grow the town. A town must have enough money in its bank to pay the daily upkeep or the town will fall. The town upkeep increases with $5 for every claim the town has. Outsiders can't steal or attack residents in the towns claimed land. If the towns nation is at war then outsiders can attack residents in the towns claimed land and the town may be conquered by a nation.<p>

									<hr />
									<h2>Nations</h2>
									<p>A nation is a collection of towns that have joined together. A nation has a capital which is the town that formed the nation. A nation can be formed with $10000. Being in a nation comes with benefits such as being able to teleport to each town in the nation, making trade and travel easier. However, towns in nations are forced into war if a nation declares war on another nation.<p>

									<hr />
									<h2>Wars</h2>
									<p>A nation can declare war on another nation in order to conquer its towns. When war is declared between two nations, protection from outsiders is removed from all towns in the nations at war. A nation can conquer towns from the other nation by killing the residents of the towns. All towns must be conquered before the capital of a nation can be conquered.<p>
